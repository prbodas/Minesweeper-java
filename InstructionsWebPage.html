			<strong>~Overview~</strong></h3>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			Minesweeper is a game of luck and skill. The board contains several cells. &quot;Safe&quot; cells reveal a number when clicked, &quot;dangerous&quot; cells explode. The objective of the game is to reveal all of the safe cells.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;">
			<strong>~Gameplay~</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Gameplay begins with&nbsp;<em><strong>safe cells</strong></em>, which&nbsp;will either reveal a number or reveal the numbers of the closest numbered cells around it. For example, one safe cell might reveal a number two. A blank safe cell would reveal the numbers of the closest numbered cells surrounding it.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The numbers you will uncover reveal how many <em><strong>mines</strong></em> are hidden in the eight surrounding squares. These numbers can be used, alone and in tandem, to guess which cells have mines. &nbsp;You will lose the game if you click on a mine. To win, you must mark all of the cells concealing mines with a&nbsp;<em><strong>flag&nbsp;</strong></em>by clicking the right mouse button. A second right-click will display a <em><strong>question mark&nbsp;</strong></em>on top of the hidden cell, and a third will revert the cell back to its original state. To reveal a cell, left-click. If you reveal a mine, you lose the game.</p>
